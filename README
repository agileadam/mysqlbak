Execute the script with the --help switch for brief usage instructions.

DISCLAIMER:
  Please be careful with this script! Though it has performed very well, it is still a work in progress.
  Practice using this script on a "test" database first!

NOTES:
  Use the SSH options if possible! Not only will this secure the connection, this will speed up transfers considerably.
  Note that, at present, only remote backups and imports function over SSH.
  I have not yet programmed 'export' mode to function within an SSH tunnel.
